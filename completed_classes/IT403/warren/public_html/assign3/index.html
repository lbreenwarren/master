    <h1>What is a Modular Synth?</h1>
    <p>A modular synth is a type of synthesizer that is designed as to use different components possibly from different manufaturers<br>
        in order to achieve a wieder variety of possibilities. There are many different types of modular synth, the focus of this blog will be <br>
        on the most popular form, <strong>Eurorack</strong>, which is a standardization of size and interoperability in this particular subset of modular synths</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>How do modular synths work?</h2>
    <p>The functionality of modular synts take inspiration from the earlies synths back in the 1970's and function using patch cables. <br>
        Today the idea of a synthesizer in most peoples head includes a keyboard with a series of knobs and buttons which change the sound of the keyboard.<br>
        In the case of keyboard synths, all of the connections between the various componenets that make up the synthesizer are hard wired beneaththe face of the synth.<br>
        In the case of modular synths, all of these connections are made manually by the user, which allows for more creativity and freedom in making music.

    <h3>Wow, thats a lot of cables, whats going through them?</h3>
    <p>There are two types of signals which travel through the patch cable in a synthesizer, both in the form of voltage. The first is <em>audio</em>, which is an electical signal that is<br>
        oscillating at an audible rate. The second is <em>control voltage</em>, whitch can take the form of pulses, oscillations, or envelopes. The only difference between these <br>
        two types of signal is the frequency and its purpose. an audio signal is what is actually sent to the speakers for the user/audience to hear and control voltage is used to modulate<br>
        other signals, such as a filter (A filter which filters out high or low frequencies of audio) which can be modulated with contol voltage to go from off to fully on at a rate determined by the contol voltage.<br>
        A good way to think of contol voltage is to think of it as invisible fingers, in the same way one would slowly turn a knob to have some effect on the sound, control voltage can do the same thing<br>
        automatically
